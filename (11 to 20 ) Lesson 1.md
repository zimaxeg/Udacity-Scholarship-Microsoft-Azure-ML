## Text Data
Text is another example of a data type that is initially non-numerical and that must be processed before it can be fed into a machine learning algorithm. Let's have a look at some of the common tasks we might do as part of this processing.

**Normalization**

Text normalization is the process of transforming a piece of text into a canonical (official) form.
Lemmatization is an example of normalization. A lemma is the dictionary form of a word and lemmatization is the process of reducing multiple inflections to that single dictionary form.

**Vectorization**

The goal here is to identify the particular features of the text that will be relevant to us for the particular task we want to perform—and then get those features extracted in a numerical form that is accessible to the machine learning algorithm
Remember, a vector is simply an array of numbers—so there are many different ways that we can vectorize a word or a sentence, depending on how we want to use it.
